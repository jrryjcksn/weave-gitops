# TLS <TierLabel tiers="enterprise" />

By default the UI is served over https. A self-signed Certificate and Key are generated by the clusters-service when it starts.

## Disabling TLS in clusters-service

If you are doing SSL termination in another ingress controller you can disable tls in the clusters-service. Update the weave-gitops-enterprise `HelmRelease` values:

```
tls:
  enabled: false
```

## Providing your own Certificates and Keys to the clusters-service

Create a kubernetes `tls` secret that contains your TLS certs and update the weave-gitops-enterprise

Update the weave-gitops-enterprise `HelmRelease` tls section and provide the name of the tls secret:

```
tls:
  enabled: true
  secretName: my-tls-secret
```

### `cert-manager`

Install cert-manager and request a `Certificate` in the `wego-system` namespace. Provide the name of secret associated with the certificate to the weave-gitops-enterprise HelmRelease as described above.
